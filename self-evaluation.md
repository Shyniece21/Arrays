How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far? I feel more confident than I did when Javascript was intitially introduced but I will definitely need to continue to practice all of these concepts.

Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson? I always feel like I need more practice but I understand the concept overall. I am not yet confident to move through any of what I learned with arrays without referencing my notes.

What questions do you have about Arrays? I would like to get more guidance on Booleans in arrays. It took me awhile to find guidance on that part of the assignment and I am still not sure that I formatted everything the right way.
